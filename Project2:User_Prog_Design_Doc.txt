                           ARGUMENT PASSING
                           ================


---- DATA STRUCTURES ----


>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', â€˜#defineâ€™, or
>> enumeration that was necessary to implement argument passing.  
>> Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
>> We didn’t add any new global structure for argument passing, but we modified
process.c to use local variables for handling the argument list. We used argv[]
to store individual arguments after tokenizing the input command line, and argc
to count the number of arguments. These were then used to push the arguments 
onto the user stack. The existing stack pointer esp was updated as needed. The 
purpose was to correctly parse user commands, store them in memory, and make 
sure the arguments are arranged on the user stack in the correct order.


---- ALGORITHMS ----


>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?  Is it enough to limit
>> the size of the incoming commandline?  Why or Why not?
>> Our implementation of the argument parsing splits in the input command line 
using the strtok_r() funciton, which separated the command string into tokens. 
These tokens are stored temporarily in an array, and then pushed onto the stack
in reverse order to make sure that argv[0] points to the first argument. We 
ensure 4-byte alignment for stack and veify that the args and points don't 
exceed the stack page limit by check PHYS_BASE.


---- RATIONALE ----


>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
>> It uses strtok_r() beacuse strtok() isn't thread-safe. The non-reentrant 
version uses internal static data to store parsing state, which would lead to 
data races and corruption if multiple threads were parsing command lines at the
same time. On the other hand, strtok_r() maintains its state in user-provied 
variables, which allows each thread to safely parse.


>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.
>> In Pintos, the kernel performs argument separation, but in Unix-like 
systems, it's done by the shell. One advantage of the Unix approach is 
flexibility, meaning the shell can handle command parsing features like pipes 
and redirection without complicating the kernel. Another advantage is 
modularity, since parsing happens in user space, the kernel's system call 
interface remains simple and consistent.


                             SYSTEM CALLS
                             ============


---- DATA STRUCTURES ----


>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', â€˜#defineâ€™, or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
>>


>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?
>>


---- ALGORITHMS ----


>> B3: Describe your code for accessing user data in the
>> kernel.
>>


>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  Based on your code, 
>> what is the least and the greatest possible number of inspections of 
>> the page table (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  
>> What about for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there 
>> room for improvement in these numbers, and how much?
>>


>> B5: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> sentences, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.
>>


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----


>> B6: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.
>>


>> B7: Consider parent process P with child process C.  Explain how
>> how your code ensures synchronization and avoids race conditions
>> in each of the following cases:
>> a) when P calls wait(C) before C exits?  
>> b) when P calls wait(C) after C exits?  
>> c) when P terminates without waiting before C exits?  
>> d) when P terminates without waiting after C exits?  
>> e) Are there any special cases?
>>


>> B8: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?
>>


---- RATIONALE ----


>> B9: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?
>>


>> B10: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?
>>


                           SURVEY QUESTIONS
                           ================


Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave

>>


>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
