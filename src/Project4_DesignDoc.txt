                    +-------------------------+


The questions in this design document should reflect the design of the code you 
wrote for the project.   Your grade will reflect both the quality of your 
answer in this document and the quality of the design implementation in your 
code.  You may receive partial credit for answering questions for parts of 
the project that you did not get to implement, but you must indicate in your 
answer that there is no corresponding implementation, or you will not receive 
any credit.


For each question, you should include both the name of the file(s), function 
name(s), and the line numbers where the relevant code may be found.


These design documents will be completed and submitted as a group.  Please use 
this document as a guide for design and discuss the questions and their 
potential answers prior to beginning implementation.


When you have completed your design document, submit it to the Canvas 
assignment Project 4 Design and Documentation.   


***Your submission must be a text file and each line must not extend past 80 
characters.  In addition, your submission must contain all of the original 
material and not exceed 18,000 characters.  The character count will be 
measured using the Linux command wc.  (Note that rtf files are NOT text files.)

                     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES
                     ============================

struct indirect_block {
  block_sector_t direct[128];
};
struct storing 128 sector pointers for single indirect blocks

struct doubly_indirect_block {
  block_sector_t indirect[128];
}; struct storing 128 indirect block pointers for double indirect addressing

struct inode_disk {
  ...
  block_sector_t direct[12]; 
  block_sector_t indirect;
  block_sector_t double_indirect;
  ...
};
On-disk inode with 12 direct pointers,one single-indirect pointer, 
one double-indirect pointer for indexed file structure

struct inode {
  ...
  struct lock inode_lock;
};
inode lock for each inode for synchronizing 
access to inode operations and preventing race conditions.

static struct lock inode_list_lock;
lock protecting list of open inodes from concurrent modifications

static struct lock free_map_lock;
lock synchronizing free map allocation and release to 
prevent sector conflicts


>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.
>> 12 direct pointers, one single-indeirect block containing 128 pointers, and
one doubly-indirect block that references 128 indirect blocks, each containing
128 data pointers. Therefore, 12+128+(128*128) = 16,524 data sectors. Each
sector is 512 bytes, to max file size is 16,524*512= 8,460,288 bytes.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----


>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.
>> We prevent races during file extension by using a per-inode lock that is 
acquired at the strt of inode_write_at(). when two processes try to extend the
file simultaneously, only one may hold the lock at a time, which makes sure 
that allocating new sectors, updating the inode's length, or modifying indirect
blocks happen in a serialized manner.


>> A4: Suppose processes A and B both have file F open, both
>> positioned at end-of-file.  If A reads and B writes F at the same
>> time, A may read all, part, or none of what B writes.  However, A
>> may not read data other than what B writes, e.g. if B writes
>> nonzero data, A is not allowed to see all zeros.  Explain how your
>> code avoids this race.
>> The race between one process reading at the end-of-file and another writing
is prevented because both inode_reat_at and inode_write_at acquire the same 
inode_lock. Since these two operations can't run their critical sections 
concurrently, a reader neve sees partially written metadata or newly allocated
blocks that haven't been initialized. When a writer extends the file, it 
zero-fills new sectors before releasing the lock, making sure readers never
encounter garbage or leftover data.




>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".
>> File access is "fair" if readers cannot indefinitely block writers
>> or vice versa.  That is, one or many processes reading from a file
>> cannot forever prevent another process from writing to the file, and
>> one or many processes writing to a file cannot forever prevent
>> another process from reading the file.
>> Fairness arises because both readers and writers use the same per-inode 
mutex, which makes sure that neither type of operation can get ahead of the 
other indefinitely. Since critical sections are short (limited to metadata
updates, block allocation), threads release the lock quickly, giving the 
scheduler frequent opportunities to switch between readers and writers, and 
this prevents starvation. 








---- RATIONALE ----


>> A6: Is your file layout a multilevel indexed structure?  If so, why
>> did you choose this particular combination of direct, indirect, and
>> doubly indirect blocks?  If not, why did you choose an alternative
>> file structure, and what advantages and disadvantages does your
>> structure have, compared to a multilevel index?
>> In your explanation, include at least two reasons to support your 
>> choices.
>> We use a multilevel indexed inode with 12 direct pointers, one 
single-indirect pointer, and one double-indirect pointer bevcause this 
structure has the best balance between performance and scalability. Small files
have fast access through direct blocks, medium-sized files expand through the 
single-indirect block, and super large files have a lot of capacity through the
double-indirect block without inflating the inode itself, it allows large files
to grow incrementally.

                            ==============


---- DATA STRUCTURES ----


>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', â€˜#defineâ€™, or
>> enumeration that was necessary for your subdirectory 
>> implementation.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
>> 
struct dir {
  struct inode *inode;
  off_t pos;
};
Inmemory directory structure wrapping an inode with current read position

struct dir_entry {
  block_sector_t inode_sector;
  char name[NAME_MAX + 1];
  bool in_use;
};
directory entry mapping a file name to inode sector number

struct inode_disk {
  ...
  uint32_t is_dir;
  ...
};
 flag in on disk inode indicating whether
the inode represents a directory or regular file

struct thread {
  ...
  struct dir *cwd;
  ...
};
current working directory pointer for each thread to 
support relative path 


---- ALGORITHMS ----


>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?
>> Path traversal starts by normalizing the user-supplied path and splitting 
into a directory portion and a final name. Absolute paths begin at the root 
directory, while relative paths begin at the calling thread's current working 
directory. The traversal goes on component by component, "." stays in the same 
directory, ".." moves to the parent, and all other tokens through lookups in 
the current directory's data blocks. For each name, the code opens the 
corresponding inode and advances deeper into the tree until it reaches the 
directory that has the final component. Absolute and relative paths only differ
in their starting directory, the rest is basically the same.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----


>> B3: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.
>> We prevent races on directory entries by relying on the directory's backing
inode lock, which serialized all operationg that read or modify the directory 
file. Both dir_add and dir_remove internally call inode_read_at and 
inode_write_at, each of which acquires the same inode_lock. Because the check
for whether a name already exists and the subsequent write occur under the same
lock, only one of two simultaneously creates or removes can succeed for any 
given filename.



>> B4: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
>> is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current
>> working directory?  If so, what happens to that process's future
>> file system operations?  If thatâ€™s not allowed, how do you
>> prevent it?
>> We don't allow a directory to be removed if it' concurrently open or used as
a thread's working directory. The directory removal logic checks whether the 
directory's inode has more than one opener and rejects removal when it does, 
which prevents deletion while any process still holds it open. The removal code
also checks whether the directory i the caller's current working directory and 
refuses the operaiton if so, avoiding cases where a process's future file 
operations would refer to a deleted location.






---- RATIONALE ----


>> B5: What type of variable/structure did you use to represent the 
>> current directory of a process?   Why did you choose this 
>> representation?  Give at least two reasons.
>> Each thread's current directory is stored as a struct dir *cwd pointer 
within the thread structure. This representation is efficient because it allows
direct access to the underlying directory inode without repeatedly parsing or 
resolving the directory path. Storying a directory pointer avoids expensive 
path computations and makes sure consistent semantics for relative paths across
all filesystem operaitons.
