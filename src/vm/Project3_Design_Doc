                   +---------------------------+




For this project, each group will need to submit a data structure and design
milestone.  The questions in this design document should reflect the planned
design of your project.  Your grade will reflect the quality of your answer in
both clarity of communication and practicality of design.

This design document will be completed and submitted as a group.  When you have
completed your design submit it to the Canvas assignment Project 3 Data
Structures and Design.

We will return this milestone to you as quickly as possible so that you can get
feedback on your design, but do not wait to begin your implementation. Please
start your implementation as soon as you are finished designing your project.

***Your submission must be a text file and each line must not extend past 80
characters.  In addition, your submission must contain all of the original
material and not exceed 12,500 characters.  The character count will be
measured using the Linux command wc.  (Note that rtf files are NOT text files.)

You may not use slip days on this portion of the project.

                        PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
                        =====================


---- DATA STRUCTURES ----


>> A1: Consider the supplemental page table. For this data structure, submit:
>>
>>    1) the C declarations of these data structures
>>    2) a few bullets or sentences about each data structure describing:
>>        a) how it is populated,
>>        b) how it is accessed,
>>        c) how it is destroyed,
>>        d) the expected size of that data structure,
>>	  e) how many of that data structure you expect to exist in your
>>           system, and 
>>        f) how many processes could potentially touch that data.
>>


---- ALGORITHMS ----


>> A2: What data will be necessary when a process page faults in the 
>> code segment? How will your implementation locate that necessary data?
>>



>> A3: How will your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that are aliases for the same
>> frame, or alternatively how do you plan to avoid the issue?
>>


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----


>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> what race conditions are possible?  How will they be avoided?
>>



                       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
                       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----


>> B1A: Consider the frame table. For this data structure, submit:
>>
>>    1) the C declarations of these data structures
>>    2) a few bullets or sentences about each data structure describing:
>>        a) how it is populated,
>>        b) how it is accessed,
>>        c) how it is destroyed,
>>        d) the expected size of that data structure,
>>	  e) how many of that data structure you expect to exist in your
>>           system, and 
>>        f) how many processes could potentially touch that data.
>>


>> B1B: Consider the swap table. For this data structure, submit:
>>
>>    1) the C declarations of these data structures
>>    2) a few bullets or sentences about each data structure describing:
>>        a) how it is populated,
>>        b) how it is accessed,
>>        c) how it is destroyed,
>>        d) the expected size of that data structure,
>>        e) how many of that data structure you expect to exist in your
>>           system, and 
>>        f) how many processes could potentially touch that data.
>>


---- ALGORITHMS ----


>> B2: When a frame is required but none are free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your algorithm for choosing a frame to evict.
>>


>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how will you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect that Q no longer has the frame?
>>


>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether or not page fault 
>> for an invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended.
>>



---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----


>> B5: Explain the basics of how you plan to manage synchronization in your VM
>> design.  In particular, explain how it will prevent deadlock. 
>>


>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's page
>> to be evicted.  How will you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How will you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's page and Q faulting the page back in?
>>


>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the filesystem or swap.  How will you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by, for example, attempting to evict a page while it is
>> still being read in?
>>


>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Will you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or will you have a mechanism for "locking" frames
>> into physical memory, or will you use some other design?  If your method
>> could result in potential deadlock, how will you prevent it?
